## Welcome.

This is the github repo for this project. 

## Getting started.

Please do the following to ensure we are all on the same page. 

1. Create a branch with your name.
2. Check out that branch and then make a commit to it.
    1. This commit should have a file named hello.htm.
    2. Edit your hello.htm so that it has your name in the hello world line so that it says "hello world, I am"+yourName, where yourName is your name.
    3. you must do a git add to add the files you want. This is git basics, if you don't know what I am talking about, see this link. [Git documentation.](http://www.git-scm.com/book)
    4. Then finally commit your commit, and the -m option followed by a message will ensure that other members know what the commit is. An example follows.
        git commit -m "This is a test commit."
    5. Do git push with your branch name. You may have to supply origin to it. An example follows pushing my branch (derek) to the server. The server will prompt you for your username and password. 
        git push origion derek 

If all goes well, we should all be on the same page after this, and we can get started.
